      &emsp;&emsp;Inter -Varsity Youth Festivals (UNIFESTS) are organized annually to showcase the latent talents of
      selected university youth artistes. The Event is conducted at Five Zonal and One National level annually through
      financial assistance from the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, GoI; comprising 25 cultural and literary
      competitions. As a prelude to AIU UNIFESTS, prospective participants are screened from the Inter-College
      Youth Festivals which are organized by respective universities on the pattern of AIU UNIFESTS. The process
      runs from August to February yearly. The UNIFESTS are regarded as the most thrilling, popular and an eagerly
      awaited annual youth activity for the university youth.</p>
    <p class="para" style="margin-right: 20px;">
      &emsp;&emsp;The South Asian Universities Youth Festival (SAUFEST) is a noble concept of the Association of Indian
      Universities (AIU) ensuing from a goal to promote active collaboration and mutual understanding amongst the South
      Asian countries in educational, social, cultural and economic fields. The UNIFESTS are regarded as the most
      thrilling, popular and an eagerly awaited annual youth activity for the university youth. The idea of organizing
      SAUFEST was initiated by the AIU to encourage the future generations of youth from the South Asian Countries to
      come on common platform for sharing views, experiences, innovations and common ideas so that a common agenda in
      taking the future regional challenges can be taken up..</p>
